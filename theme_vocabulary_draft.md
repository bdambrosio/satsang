# Contemplative Theme Vocabulary — Draft v1

## Design Principles
- Each theme should be recognizable across at least 3 major traditions
- Themes describe *experiential territory*, not doctrinal categories
- A passage should typically receive 2-4 themes, rarely more than 5
- Themes should be distinguishable enough that two annotators would mostly agree
- The vocabulary must work for tagging Ramana, the cross-tradition corpus, AND live conversation

## Core Themes (organized by cluster, not hierarchy)

### The Nature of Self
1. **self-inquiry** — Direct investigation into "Who am I?", the nature of the subject, turning attention toward the one who perceives. Ramana's central method. Resonates with Socratic "know thyself," Zen koan work, Augustine's interior turn.

2. **ego-dissolution** — The unreality, transparency, or death of the separate self. The constructed "I" seen through. Includes Eckhart's *Gelassenheit*, Buddhist anatta, Ramana on the ego as phantom.

3. **true-nature** — Recognition of what one already is. The Self, Buddha-nature, the divine ground, *sat-chit-ananda*. Not attainment but uncovering. The "ever-present" quality.

4. **witness-awareness** — Pure consciousness as distinct from its contents. The seer versus the seen. *Sakshi*. Observer without involvement.

### The Path and Its Paradoxes
5. **surrender** — Letting go of personal will, effort, control. Submission to God, guru, or reality as it is. *Prapatti*, *islam* (in its literal sense), Eckhart's detachment, Taoist *wu wei* when framed as yielding.

6. **effortless-effort** — The paradox that practice aims at what is already the case. Trying to stop trying. The pathless path. The gate that was always open.

7. **beyond-knowledge** — The limits of intellect, concept, and language. Apophatic theology, *neti neti*, the Cloud of Unknowing, Zen "not knowing." What cannot be grasped by mind.

8. **direct-experience** — Primacy of immediate knowing over scripture, doctrine, or secondhand report. "Be as you are." Taste versus description. The finger and the moon.

### Mind and Its Nature
9. **nature-of-mind** — How thought arises, sustains, and dissolves. The mechanics of mental activity. The mind as obstacle and instrument. Source of thought.

10. **stillness** — Silence, cessation of mental activity, *mauna*. Not as technique but as the ground. "Be still and know." The silence between thoughts. Inner quiet.

11. **attention** — The role of focused awareness as practice. Where attention goes, what it illuminates. Vigilance, watchfulness, mindfulness in its original sense. *Prosoche* in the Desert Fathers.

12. **detachment** — Non-clinging, dispassion, *vairagya*. Freedom from outcomes. Not indifference but non-grasping. Stoic *apatheia*, Buddhist non-attachment.

### The World and Appearance
13. **illusion** — The world as not what it seems. *Maya*, the veil, Plato's cave, the dream metaphor. Not nihilistic denial but seeing through appearances to what underlies them.

14. **unity** — Nonduality, the collapse of subject-object division. All is one, *advaita*. The mystic's perception of undifferentiated reality. Includes *unio mystica*.

15. **ordinary-life** — The sacred in the everyday. Enlightenment not separate from washing dishes. *Sahaja*, Zen's "chop wood, carry water." Ramana's insistence that realization doesn't require renunciation.

16. **impermanence** — Transience of all phenomena. Buddhist *anicca*, Stoic *memento mori*, Ecclesiastes. The passing nature of experience as pointer to what doesn't pass.

### Suffering and Liberation
17. **suffering** — The nature of pain, dissatisfaction, *dukkha*. Not as problem to solve but as doorway. What suffering reveals. The role of suffering in awakening.

18. **desire** — Craving, wanting, attachment to objects and outcomes. The mechanism by which the ego sustains itself. Freedom from desire versus suppression of desire.

19. **liberation** — *Moksha*, *nirvana*, salvation, freedom. The end of seeking. What is realized when illusion drops. Not a future state but present recognition.

20. **death** — Physical death, ego-death, the death experience as spiritual catalyst. Ramana's death experience at 16. *Maranasati*, dying before you die.

### Relationship and Grace
21. **guru-grace** — The role of the teacher, transmission, *darshan*. Grace as what makes realization possible. The guru as mirror, as Self. Not limited to human teachers — Ramana on Arunachala.

22. **devotion** — *Bhakti*, love of God, the heart's movement toward the divine. Surrender through love rather than inquiry. Rumi, Mirabai, the Psalms, John of the Cross.

23. **compassion** — Response to the suffering of others from a place of understanding. *Karuna*. The bodhisattva impulse. Not sentimentality but clarity expressing as care.

### The Absolute
24. **the-source** — Origin of all manifestation. The Heart (*hridayam*), the ground of being, *Brahman*, the Tao, the Godhead behind God. Where inquiry terminates.

25. **presence** — Being itself, prior to doing or knowing. "I am." Pure existence without qualification. The felt sense of *being* as distinct from being *something*.

26. **the-sacred** — Encounter with the numinous, the holy, the transcendent breaking through. Awe, reverence, *mysterium tremendum*. The burning bush. Arunachala.

## Possible Additions (include if 25 feels too tight)

27. **practice-as-life** — Integration of spiritual work into all activity. Not retreat from the world. Karma yoga, Brother Lawrence's "practice of the presence," Ramana's "work is no hindrance."

28. **paradox** — Teachings that work through contradiction or apparent impossibility. Koans, apophatic speech, "destroy the mind by the mind." The logic that breaks logic.

29. **body** — The role of embodiment in spiritual life. Breath, sensation, somatic awareness. Hatha yoga, Taoist alchemy, the body as temple or obstacle.

30. **scripture-and-tradition** — Relationship to inherited teaching, texts, lineage. When to follow, when to abandon. The map versus the territory.

## Notes for Annotation Prompt
- Assign 2-4 themes per document (at manifest level) or per chunk (at chunk level)
- Order by relevance: first theme listed is the strongest match
- A text heavy in philosophical argument about nonduality might get: unity, beyond-knowledge, true-nature
- A Rumi love poem about dissolution in God might get: devotion, ego-dissolution, unity
- A Ramana dialogue about "who am I?" would get: self-inquiry, ego-dissolution, true-nature
- Epictetus on what is in our control: detachment, nature-of-mind, ordinary-life
