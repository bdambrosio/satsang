Mungo Parke tells us\nthat when he asked the desert Arabs this conundrum, they replied that the\ninquiry was frivolous and childish, as being wholly beyond the capacities\nof the human mind. The Aztecs did not think so, and had framed a definite\ntheory which overcame the difficulty. It was that, in fact, the sun only\nadvances to the zenith, and then returns to the East, from whence it\nstarted. What we seem to see as the sun between the zenith and the western\nhorizon is, in reality, not the orb itself, but only its _brightness_, one\nof its accidents, not its substance, to use the terms of metaphysics.\nHence to the Aztec astronomer and sage, the house of the sun is always\ntoward the East.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Ramirez de Fuen-leal, _Historia_, cap. xx, p. 102.]\n\nWe need not have recourse even to this explanation.

We have it on record that in Peru this was the direct\nfruit of the myth of Viracocha. It is related that the Inca Yupangui\npublished to his people that to him had appeared Viracocha, with\nadmonition that he alone was lord of the world, and creator of all things;\nthat he had made the heavens, the sun, and man; and that it was not right\nthat these, his works, should receive equal homage with himself.\nTherefore, the Inca decreed that the image of Viracocha should thereafter\nbe assigned supremacy to those of all other divinities, and that no\ntribute nor sacrifice should be paid to him, for He was master of all the\nearth, and could take from it as he chose.[1] This was evidently a direct\nattempt on the part of an enlightened ruler to lift his people from a\nlower to a higher form of religion, from idolatry to theism. The Inca even\nwent so far as to banish all images of Viracocha from his temples, so that\nthis, the greatest of gods, should be worshiped as an immaterial spirit\nonly.", "text_words": 213}
