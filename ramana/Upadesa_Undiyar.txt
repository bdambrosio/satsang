Karma giving fruit is by the ordainment of God [the karta or Ordainer]. Can karma be God, since karma is insentient [jada]?

The fruit of action having perished [by being experienced in the form of pleasure or pain], will as seeds make one fall into the ocean of action and [hence] will not give liberation.

Desireless action [nishkamya karma] dedicated to God will purify the mind and it will show the path to liberation.

This is certain, puja, japa and dhyana are actions of the body, speech and mind [respectively]; rather than [each preceding] one, [the succeeding] one is superior.

Worship [any of the eight forms] thinking that all the eight forms are forms of God, is good worship [puja] of God.

Rather than praising [God], [japa is good]; [rather than japa done in] a loud voice, [japa faintly whispered within the mouth is good]; and rather than japa within the mouth, that which is done by mind is good; this [mental repetition or manasika japa]is what is called meditation [dhyana].

Rather than meditation interrupted [by other thoughts], uninterrupted meditation [upon God], like a river or the falling of ghee, is excellent to do.

Rather than anya-bhava, ananya-bhava [done with the conviction] ‘He is I’ is indeed the best among all [the various kinds of meditation].

By the strength of meditation [that is, by the strength of such ananya-bhava or Self-attention], abiding in the state of being, which transcends meditation, alone is the truth of supreme devotion [para-bhakti-tattva].

Abiding, having subsided in the place of rising [in one’s source, the real Self] – that is karma [desireless action] and bhakti [devotion], that is yoga [union with God] and jnana [true knowledge].

By restraining the breath within, the mind will also subside, like a bird caught in a net. This [practice of breath-restraint] is a device to restrain [the mind].

Subsidence [of mind] is of two kinds, abeyance [laya] and destruction [nasa]. That which is in abeyance [laya] will rise. [But] if the form dies, it will not rise.

When one makes the mind, which has subsided by restraining the breath, go on the one path [of knowing and becoming one with Self], its form will die.

The mind knowing its own form of light [its true form of mere consciousness, the real Self], having given up [knowing] external objects, alone is true knowledge.

When one scrutinizes the form of the mind without forgetfulness [that is, without pramada or slackness of attention], [it will be found that] there is no such thing as mind; this is the direct path for all.

The mind is only [the multitude of] thoughts. Of all [these thoughts], the thought ‘I’ [the feeling ‘I am the body’] alone is the root. [Therefore]what is called mind is [this root-thought] ‘I’.

When one scrutinizes within thus, ‘What is the rising-place of ‘I’?’, the ‘I’ will die. This is Selfenquiry [jnana-vichara].

In the place where ‘I’ [the mind or ego] merges, the one [existence-consciousness] appears spontaneously as ‘I-I’ [or ‘I am I’]. That itself is the Whole [purna].

That [‘I-I’, the whole] is always the import of the word ‘I’, because we exist [literally, because of the absence of our non-existence] even in sleep, which is devoid of ‘I’ [the thought ‘I’, the mind].

Since the body, mind, intellect, breath and the darkness [of ignorance which remains in sleep] are all insentient [jada] and unreal [asat], they are not ‘I’, which is the reality [sat].

Because of the non-existence of another consciousness to know that which exists, that which exists [the reality or sat] is consciousness [or chit]. [That] consciousness itself is ‘we’ [the real Self].

By existing nature [that is, in their real nature, which is existence or sat], God and souls are only one substance [or vastu]. [Their] adjunct-knowledge [or adjunct-consciousness] alone is different.

Knowing oneself having given up [one’s own] adjuncts [upadhis], is itself knowing God, because He shines as oneself [as one’s own reality, ‘I am’].

Being Self is itself knowing Self, because Self is that which is not two. This is abidance as the reality (tanmaya-nishta).

The knowledge which is devoid of both knowledge and ignorance [about objects], alone is [real] knowledge. This is the truth, [because in the state of Self-experience] there is nothing to know [other than oneself].

If one knows what one’s own nature is, then [what will remain and shine is only] the beginningless, endless and unbroken existence-consciousness-bliss [anadi ananta akhanda satchit-ananda].

Abiding in this state [of Self], having attained the supreme bliss [mentioned in the previous verse], which is devoid of bondage and liberation, is abiding in the service of God [or is abiding as enjoined by God].

‘What [is experienced] if one knows that which remains after ‘I’ has ceased to exist, that alone is excellent tapas’ – thus said Lord Ramana, who is Self.
