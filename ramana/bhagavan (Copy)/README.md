# Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi Texts

This directory contains three foundational texts by or about Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950), a 20th century Indian sage and philosopher who taught the path of self-inquiry (ātma-vicāra).

## Contents

### Nan_Ar.txt
**"Who am I?"** (Nāṉ Yār?)

A prose text containing Sri Ramana's core teachings on self-inquiry. It explains:
- The method of investigating "Who am I?" to discover one's true nature
- The nature of the mind, ego, and world
- The relationship between the self (ātma-svarūpa) and phenomena
- Practical guidance for spiritual practice (sādhana)

This text serves as an introduction to Sri Ramana's teachings and is often recommended as a starting point for those interested in his philosophy.

### Ulladu_Narpadu.txt
**"Forty Verses on Reality"** (Uḷḷadu Nāṟpadu)

A poetic work consisting of 40 verses plus 2 maṅgalam (auspicious) verses. The verses systematically explore:
- The nature of reality and appearance
- The relationship between the ego, mind, and world
- The distinction between knowledge and ignorance
- The path to liberation through self-knowledge

Each verse is a concise statement that can be contemplated independently, making this text suitable for both study and meditation.

### Upadesa_Undiyar.txt
**"The Essence of Spiritual Instruction"** (Upadēśa Uṇḍiyār)

A text composed by Sri Ramana for Muruganar, explaining the essence of spiritual practice. It covers:
- The relationship between karma (action) and liberation
- Progressive stages of spiritual practice: puja (worship), japa (repetition), dhyana (meditation)
- The practice of self-inquiry (jñāna-vicāra)
- The nature of true knowledge and abidance in the Self

This text provides practical guidance on the path from initial spiritual practice to final realization.

## Relationship Between Texts

These three texts form a complementary set:
- **Nan_Ar.txt** provides the foundational method and philosophy
- **Ulladu_Narpadu.txt** offers systematic philosophical exposition in verse form
- **Upadesa_Undiyar.txt** gives practical guidance on spiritual practice

Together, they present Sri Ramana's complete teaching: the method (self-inquiry), the understanding (nature of reality), and the practice (stages of spiritual development).

## Key Concepts

- **Self-inquiry (ātma-vicāra)**: The practice of investigating "Who am I?" to discover one's true nature
- **Ego (ahamkāra)**: The false identification with the body and mind
- **Mind (manas)**: The collection of thoughts, with the "I" thought as the root
- **Self (ātma-svarūpa)**: One's true nature, which is existence-consciousness-bliss (sat-cit-ānanda)
- **Liberation (mukti)**: The dissolution of the ego and abidance in one's true nature

## Use Cases

These texts are useful for:
- Understanding Advaita Vedanta philosophy
- Studying Sri Ramana Maharshi's teachings
- Contemplation and spiritual practice
- Comparative religious studies
- Philosophical inquiry into the nature of self and reality
