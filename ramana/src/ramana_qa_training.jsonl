{"ref": "29-5", "type": "direct_qa", "question": "What is pranayama?", "answer": "“Prana” is equivalent to Self, Soul, Atman, etc. as it is the life-current, whatever name you give it. Pranayama is the control of the body, the\n\nsense and the intellect through the breath. Mind is thus controlled and thus dies down with this practice. Mind and prana originate from the same source. By control of breath mind subsides and then an unconscious blank state is produced, a swoon or trance like death. Although that state is the natural state, the man who has not controlled mind is dazed and is merged in it. It is a state of great peace, true, but it is temporary, and when it ends the yogi wants control again. It is necessary for him to go beyond pranayama and to gain directcontrol of the mind, and thus practice a permanent peace, sahaja samadhi—not merely temporary samadhi. The thing is to get the capacity to bring mind to peace, to make it still, and not allow it to wander. For that pranayama is given out.\nRetention of breath, this leads to contemplation but as that is for the advanced man; puraka is the beginning, the comes kumbaka and last is rechaka. Pranayama is useful only in so far as it helps to get mind-control. For those who seek mental peace this is enough, but there is a highly-detailed, complicated Pranayama for those who seek siddhis—occult powers. Pranayama is for one not endowed with the strength to control mind. There is no way so sure as the sages’ company for this purpose. Pranayama need not be exactly as described in Hatha yoga. If engaged in devotion or meditation, just a little control of breath will suffice to control mind. Mind is rider and breath the horse.\nPranayama is a check on the horse. By that check the rider is checked. It may be done just a little. Watching the breath is one way to do it. The mind is abstracted from other activities and engaged in watching the breath. That controls breath and in its turn mind. If unable to do rechaka and puraka, do not care. Breath may be retained a short while during meditation. Then too\n\ngood results will accrue. Regulation of breath is gained by watching its movements. Similarly if the mind is watched the thoughts will cease too.

Watching the inspiration and expiration is also pranayama.\nThese methods are threefold apparently only. They are in fact only one because they lead to the same goal.

Or, the floating body might be loaded with weights and made to sink. So also Satsanga will make the mind sink\n\ninto the heart. Satsanga is both out and in. The externally visible guru pushes the mind inward. He is also in the hearts of the seekers and so he draws the inward bent mind into the heart. This question is asked only when the man begins to meditate and finds the difficult. Let him practice Pranayama just a little; the mind will be purified. It does not now sink into the heart. But it is restrictive and moves about due to Samskaras. When the samskaras are made ineffective, it will be restful and at peace. By pranayama, the mind will be quiescent only temporarily, because the samskaras are still there. If the mind is made Atmakara, it will no longer give trouble. That is done by meditation. It is necessary to be aware while controlling thoughts. Otherwise it will lead to sleep. Awareness is the chief factor, is indicated by the fact of emphasising Pratyahar, Dharan, Dhyan, Samadhi, even after\nPranayama. Pranayam makes the mind steady and suppresses thoughts. Why is this not enough? Because awareness then is the one necessary factor.

{"ref": "81-3", "type": "direct_qa", "question": "Is the Jiva capable of spiritual progress in the animal body?", "answer": "Death is intervening sleep between two successive births while sleep intervenes between two jagrats and both are transient. According to the Sanskrit saying: “A wife is half the body of the husband,” no doubt it is a very sad thing for the husband if his wife dies. If one begins to think in terms of his Atma, there is no sorrow at all. According to the Scriptures, a wife is dear because she pleases her husband by acting up to his wishes. Then if all this is for the pleasure of the Atman, where is the sorrow? In spite of this, even persons who have got a glimpse of the\nReal Knowledge, lose their mental equipoise when such calamities occur. During sleep one is happy. The Self remains happy in sleep and did not see the wife. But now in the waking state, the same self which was happy in sleep, enjoys happiness or misery owing to the presence of worldly things. Why should not the happiness enjoyed in sleep by the Self be enjoyed in the waking state also? The knowledge of the identity of body with Atman is the obstruction for enjoying Bliss. That which existed is always present; and that\n\nwhich never existed cannot exist. What is born?\nWhat is it that dies? Waking is birth and sleeping is death. Did your wife accompany you whenever you attended to your duties and during your sleep? She was staying separately somewhere, but you were then thinking that she was living.\nNow after her death you think that she does not exist. Therefore the difference about your wife is in the kind of thoughts that constitutes your sorrow that she does not exist. The whole thing is a creation of your mind. It is that which is known as sorrow owing to the thought of non-existence (of the wife). The whole is mental imagination. In his own self which is by nature full of happiness or creates sorrow.\nWhy should there be grief for the sake of those who are dead and since they have been freed from bondage. The self creates grief by entering into the thought about the dead person. Why should there be any concern if a person is dead or exists?\nYou must destroy your personal ego. There is no sorrow at all if one’s ego is dead.\nLeaving off the feeling of ‘I’ while the body lasts is what is called the annihilation of the ego. If the ego is not annihilated, the person will certainly feel sorry for death.\nOne cries for persons who are dead, but if the ‘I’ had been annihilated before they died, then there is no necessity for his crying for them. Our experience or happiness is only during profound sleep when we have ceased to think of our bodies. Even wise men, a Jnani speaks of disembodied liberation. Therefore a wise man, i.e. a\nJnani72 looks for when he shall cast off his body. Just as a cook who carries a load in his head feels relieved soon after he reaches his destination and places it on the ground from off his head, so a Jnani73 abides his time to cast off this load of his embodiment in flesh and blood. Therefore the death of the wife who is termed half the body of the husband should relieve the husband\n\n72 “Gnani” in the original.\n73 “Gnani” in the original.\n\nof half his load and therefore should make him feel happy, but it is not so considered since we perceive these things through our physical senses. Even jnanis, wise men though they be, are perfectly aware of the need of being disembodied for final liberation, yet talk of liberation in the body thus implying that the body may be made to be eternal.", "tags": ["death", "ego", "jnana", "mind", "scripture", "self_inquiry", "sleep"]}

However vast and emphatic the sastras may be, they fail in their effect. The guru is quiet and peace prevails in all His silence and more vast and emphatic than all the Sastras put together.

The", "answer": "“The Tantrika and others condemn Sri Sankara’s philosophy as Maya vada, i.e. philosophy of illusion, without understanding him aright. What does he say? (1) Brahma is real. (2) the universe is unreal, a myth. (3)\nBrahma is the universe. The Tantrika may be justified if Sri Sankara had stopped with his second statement but he amplifies the first two statements with the third one. What does it signify? It signifies that perception is wrong and illusory. The antagonists point to\n\nillusion—snake in the rope, and think they have him clinced. This analogy is used by him to explain unqualified myth. After the truth of the rope is known, the illusion of the snake is removed once and for all.\nSince this illustration does not completely clarify the position he presses another analogy to his aid i.e. the mirage. Its mythical nature is qualified. A mirage does not disappear even after knowing it to be mirage. The appearance persists but now the man does not run to it for water. Similarly, the world persists in its appearance even though it is known to be unreal. The disputants continue to argue as follows:\n“Admitting both the illustrations, now is the world proved to be unreal? The water of the mirage is certainly unreal because it can serve no useful purpose. But the phenomena of the world differ from it, because of their usefulness.” Sankara argues:\n“A phenomenon cannot be admitted to be real simply because it serves a purpose.”\nHe brings in the third example of the dream. The dream creations are full of purpose and they do serve the dream purpose. E.g. the dream water quenches the thirst in the dream. The dream creation is however contradicted in the waking state.\nWhat is real at one moment and unreal at the next moment cannot be said to be real.\nIf real, it should always be so. So it is with the magical creations. They appear real and are yet illusory. If then the earnest seeker asks why the world should yet appear, he replies with the counter question “To whom does it appear,” you reply must be “To the Self.” Otherwise the question will arise “Will the world appear in the absence of the cognizing self?” Therefore the Self is the Ultimate and Sole\nReality. His conclusion thus amounts to this: The phenomena are real when seen as the self, and myths when seen apart from the Self. Now what do the Tantriks say?\nThey say that the phenomena are real because they are part of the reality in which they appear.\n\nAre not these two statements the same? That is what I mean by “Reality and Illusion are the same.”", "tags": ["guru", "self_inquiry", "sleep", "world_illusion"]}

Thus everyone, even a child, of every creed or race, when referring to the ‘heart’ as a metaphor meaning the deepest feelings will nevertheless touch the breast with their hands.\nBut such discussions as inside or outside the body cannot arise in self-realisation.\nWhen you have found the centre, you will find that it is spread out to the circumference of the whole word, if you wish the radius can be extended to your body or to the world. We start with the wrong presumption that the circle is confined to the human form. Locate the centre first.

{"ref": "211-1", "type": "teaching", "text": "The intricate maze of philosophy of different schools is said to clarify matters and reveal the truth. But in fact, they create confusion where no confusion need exist. To understand anything there must be the Self. The Self is obvious. Why not remain as the Self? What need to explain the non-self? Take the Vedanta for instance:— They say there are fifteen kinds of prana. The student is made to commit the names to memory and also their functions. The air goes up and is called prana, goes down and is called apana; operates the indriyas and is called something else.\nWhy all this? Why do you classify, give names and enumerate the functions, and so on? Is it not enough to know that one prana does the whole work? The antahkarana thinks, desires, wills, reasons, etc. and each function is attributed to one name such as mind, intellect etc. Has any man seen the pranas or the antahkaranas? Have they any real being? They are mere conceptions, when and where will such conceptions end? Consider the following:— A man sleeps. He says on waking that he slept. The question is asked: Why does he not say in his sleep that he is sleeping? The answer is given that he is sunk in the Self and cannot speak like a man who was diving into water to bring something from the bottom. The diver cannot speak. When he has actually recovered the article and comes out he speaks. Well what is the explanation? Being in water, water will flow into his mouth if he were to open the mouth for speaking. Is it not simple? But the philosopher is not content with this simple fact. He explains saying that fire is the deity presiding over speech; that it is\n\ninimical to water and therefore cannot function. This is called philosophy and the learners are struggling to learn all this. Is it not sheer waste of time? Again the gods are said to preside over the limbs and senses of the individual. So they go on explaining Hiranyagarba etc. Why should confusion be created\n\nand then explained away? Fortunate is the man who does not involve himself in this maze. I was indeed fortunate that I never took t it. Had I taken to it, I would probably be nowhere, always in confusion. My vasanas fortunately took me directly to the “Whom am I” enquiry.", "tags": ["devotion", "mind", "self_inquiry", "sleep"]}

{"ref": "213-5", "type": "teaching", "text": "The Jnanis216 point out that the Yogi assumes the existence of the body, its separateness from the Self and therefore advises effort for the re-union by practice of\nYoga. The body is in the mind which has the brain for its seat which again functions by the light borrowed from another source, as admitted by the Yogis themselves in their fountain theory. The Jnani217 further argues if the light is borrowed it must come from its native source. Go to the source direct and do not depend on borrowed resources. Just as an iron ball comes into being as separate from the mass of iron along with fiery heat, it cools down later giving up the fire, but must be again made fiery to reunite with the mass, so also, the cause of separation must also form the factor of union. Again if there is an image reflected, there must be a source and also accessories like the sun, a pot and water, for\n\nreflection. To undo the reflection, either the surface may be covered corresponding to our reaching the fountain according to the\nYogis; or the water may be drained away which is called tapas i.e. the thoughts or the brain activities are made to cease: this is Jnana218 marga. All these are however on the assumption that the jiva is separate from Self or Brahman. But are we separate? “No” says the Jnani.219 The ego is simply wrong identity of the Self with the non-self as in the case of a colourless crystal and its background. The crystal though colourless appears red because of its background. If the background is removed, the crystal shines in its original purity. So it is with the Self and the\nAntahkaranas.", "tags": ["ego", "jnana", "mind", "practice", "self_inquiry"]}
