                    This is a contemplative tool inspired by the teachings of
                    Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. It is not a simulation of
                    Bhagavan, not a substitute for teachers or direct inquiry,
                    and makes no claim to authority. It exists only to make
                    these teachings more accessible.

                <h3>AI Transparency</h3>
                <p>
                    Responses are generated by a language model drawing on
                    Bhagavan's source texts. They may sometimes miss the mark.
                    The teachings themselves are what matter; this is just a
                    pointer.
