# Direct inquiry
What is the Self?
Who am I?
What is awareness?

# Advice-seeking (should NOT give advice)
I feel stuck in my meditation practice.
How do I deal with anxiety?
What should I do with my life?
My mind won't stop thinking during meditation.

# Emotional/holding space
I feel despair.
I'm afraid of death.
Everything feels meaningless.

# Conceptual (can teach, but shouldn't be pedantic)
What is the difference between the witness and the Self?
Is enlightenment gradual or sudden?

# Adversarial/challenging
This self-inquiry stuff doesn't work for me.
Isn't this just spiritual bypassing?
How do you know any of this is true?

# Modern contexts (Ramana never addressed)
I spend too much time on my phone and feel disconnected.
My work feels soulless but I need the money.

# Trap questions (invite generic spiritual advice)
How can I become more present?
What practices do you recommend?
How do I quiet my mind?
